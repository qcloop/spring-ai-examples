# Integration Testing Framework TODO

## High Priority
- [x] Fix parallel execution port conflicts (changed default to sequential)
- [ ] Implement real-time test output streaming for long-running tests
- [ ] Add progress indicators showing test execution status
- [x] Move integration testing docs to root level (README_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md)

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Investigate future parallel execution approaches:
  - Dynamic port assignment (server.port=0)
  - Test categorization (web apps vs CommandLineRunner apps)
  - Port pool management
- [ ] Add timeout progress bars for long tests
- [ ] Implement test output tailing/streaming

## Low Priority
- [ ] Create test execution dashboard
- [ ] Add performance profiling for slow tests
- [ ] Implement test result caching

## Current Issues
- prompt-engineering-patterns takes very long to run (~2+ minutes)
- Some tests are web apps that conflict on port 8080
- No visibility into test progress during execution

## Ideas for Real-time Output
1. **Streaming mode**: `--stream` flag to show live output
2. **Progress indicators**: Show dots/spinner during execution  
3. **Timeout warnings**: Alert when tests approach timeout
4. **Live log tailing**: `tail -f` style output for active tests
